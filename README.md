# Splend

Splend is the perfect group travel companion for planning events, tracking expenses, and splitting bills.

## Installation

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up and ready to run the app.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

*   **Node.js**: It is recommended to use the latest LTS version. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **npm** (Node Package Manager) or **Yarn**: npm comes bundled with Node.js. If you prefer Yarn, you can install it globally:
    ```bash
    npm install -g yarn
    ```
*   **Expo CLI**: Install the Expo CLI globally:
    ```bash
    npm install -g expo-cli
    ```

### Project Setup

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:javierchuaby/Splend.git
    cd Splend
    ```

2.  **Install project dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the App

Once you have installed all the dependencies, you can run the app using Expo CLI.

1.  **Run the app**:
    Ensure that you have XCode installed on your device.
    ```bash
    npx expo run:ios
    ```
    This will run the app in the iOS Simulator.
