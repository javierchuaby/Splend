1. npm install

# Splend

Splend is the perfect group travel companion for planning events, tracking expenses, and splitting bills.

## Installation

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up and ready to run the app.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

*   **Node.js**: It is recommended to use the latest LTS version. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **npm** (Node Package Manager) or **Yarn**: npm comes bundled with Node.js. If you prefer Yarn, you can install it globally:
    ```bash
    npm install -g yarn
    ```
*   **Expo CLI**: Install the Expo CLI globally:
    ```bash
    npm install -g expo-cli
    ```

### Project Setup

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:javierchuaby/Splend.git
    cd Splend
    ```

2.  **Install project dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the App

Once you have installed all the dependencies, you can run the app using Expo CLI.

1.  **Start the Expo development server**:
    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```
    This will open a new tab in your browser with the Expo DevTools, which provides various options to run your app.

2.  **Run the app**:

    *   **Run on iOS Simulator**:
        This app is currently only being developed with iOS in mind. Expo gets the app running in Android, iOS, and web, but there might be certain packages or UI design elements that don't completely work.
